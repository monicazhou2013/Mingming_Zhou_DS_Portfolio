# MingZe — Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Mingming Zhou, a biostatistician with four years of experience transitioning into a Data Scientist role.  
My work focuses on experiment design, A/A–A/B testing, machine learning modeling, and biotech analytics.

Below are selected projects that highlight my analytical thinking and ability to turn data into meaningful insights.

---

## 🧪 Project 1 — A/A Test for Assay Validation
Validated whether a new laboratory instrument is analytically equivalent to the existing platform using paired patient samples.  
Results include correlation plot, Bland–Altman analysis, and distribution comparison.
