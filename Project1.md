# Project 1 — A/A Test: Consistency Between Two Measurement Instruments  
### (Pictures-Only Version)

## 🧭 Background
This analysis compares the measurement **consistency** between two laboratory devices:  
- **Device A** (current platform)  
- **Device B** (candidate platform)

An **A/A test** was performed using **paired patient samples** to evaluate the agreement between the two instruments.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Determine whether Device B produces measurements that are:
- **Consistent** with Device A  
- **Unbiased**  
- Within acceptable **analytical variation** for clinical use  

*(No performance improvement or workflow claims — strictly analytical comparison.)*

---

## 📊 Key Visual Results

### 1. Correlation Between Device A and Device B  
![Correlation Plot](assets/aa_corr.png)

- Very strong correlation (≈ 0.97)  
- Points align closely with the identity line  
- Indicates high measurement agreement  

---

### 2. Bland–Altman Bias Analysis

- Mean bias is small (≈ –1%)  
- Most differences fall within acceptable limits  
- No systematic shift detected  

---

### 3. Distribution Comparison

- Nearly identical value distributions  
- No obvious skew or offset  
- Supports consistency across the measurement range  

---

## 📌 Interpretation
Across correlation, Bland–Altman, and distribution analyses,  
**Device B demonstrates strong consistency and analytical agreement with Device A.**

- No major bias  
- Stable variability  
- Comparable measurement distributions  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The A/A test results support that **Device B is analytically consistent** with Device A and may be considered a suitable alternative for measurement purposes.
